# spotify-webplayer

To run locally, you will need to have a spotify account. You will also need to create a new app at https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/ in order to obtain a client_id and client_secret. Once you have these these two values, update the keys in config/oauth-config.js. Then: 

npm install 
npm run dev
